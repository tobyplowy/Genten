# When we decide to utilize third-party software, there are things we need to consider:
* If this piece of software disappears, what is the impact?
Critical, High, Medium, Low, Non-existant
* How frequently is this updated? If it not updated frequently, what is the impact?
* How much work is involved when it does update?
* What is the probability that this third party is abandoned
* If this is abandoned, can we take it over and maintain it (what license does it have)
* If we need to switch to another third party, how much work will be involved? Are there suitable alternatives now?

For each third party, we should document somewhere, the answers to these questions.
