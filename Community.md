One of the reasons Genten was founded was to take a specific approach to community, open-source programming thrives on positive collaboration and we want to foster an environment where that can happen. In order to foster this environment, we have some guiding norms and tenents that we follow.

We are an Open and transparent community
* Meeting notes will be made public (even following a private meeting)
* We maintain open ears to discussions of changing the way we do things
* Community input is critical before making any major decision

We keep the positive vibes rolling
* We don't blame others for mistakes or life
* We don't shut down someone's idea (It may not get priority/ approval but for clearly outlined reasons)
* If someone doesn't know something, we pull them up instead of pushing them away (Respecting time)

This file is still in progress, some tenents may change, be added, or be removed and the topic is discussed further.
